# Currency-Converter

This is Currency Converter. This allows the user to select the desired currency they have and see how much it would be worth in another country!
to make this I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

# USER STORY

This website was made for the person who is going to another country for the first time and has to figure out, just how much money they would need to buy a Starbucks
drink in that country. You can also use this if you're just a curious person and want to find out how much $3,000 would be worth in a country like Brazil or China.
This website is designed to give someone an easy and simple view on the exchange rates in the world, and exactly how much it would cost them to buy a 3 bedroom condo
in France if they wish to do that as well.

# TECHNOLOGY USED 
The technology used in this project was simple HTML mixed in with some basic CSS and JavaScript as well as bootstrap.
